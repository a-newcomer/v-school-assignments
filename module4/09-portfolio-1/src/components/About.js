      <p>I live near Portland, Oregon.</p>
      <p>Having spent the first part of my career abroad as an English lecturer, I come to coding as an insider with an outsider's persepctive, which is very useful in thinking about applications, as well as when communicating with users.</p>
      <p> Front-end coding and WordPress are my favorite things to work on. I'm one of those wacky people who love CSS. I really enjoy the endless possibilities for creativity in code, as well as the continual brain-stretching opportunities.</p>
